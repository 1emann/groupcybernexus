## 📌 Project Task
As part of our **Computer Networking project**, we have developed a fully functional website to demonstrate fundamental networking principles. This project includes:

1. **Domain & Hosting** – Setting up a domain and hosting service.
2. **Website Development** – Creating a basic website using HTML and CSS.
3. **Networking Aspects** – Applying core networking concepts such as DNS, IP addressing, and protocols.
4. **Documentation** – Providing a detailed report on our setup, challenges, and networking principles.
5. **Bonus Features** – Implementing security features such as HTTPS and Firewall.

## 🌍 Domain & Hosting
We chose **GitHub Pages** as our hosting platform due to its reliability and ease of deployment for static websites. Our website is live at:

🔗 [CyberNexus Networking Hub](https://1emann.github.io/groupcybernexus/)

### Hosting Details:
- **Hosting Service**: GitHub Pages
- **Domain Name**: 1emann.github.io/groupcybernexus
- **DNS Handling**: GitHub automatically assigns an IP address and manages DNS resolution.

---

## 🛠 Website Setup
We built the website using the following technologies:
- **HTML & CSS** – Structuring and styling the website.
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and managing version control.

---

## 🌐 Networking Aspects
To ensure our website is **accessible online**, we applied key networking principles:

- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Resolves our GitHub Pages domain to an IP address.
- **IP Addressing** – GitHub assigns an IP for hosting, making it globally reachable.
- **Protocols Used**:
  - **HTTP/HTTPS** – Communication between clients and the server.
  - **TCP/IP** – Ensuring reliable data transfer.
  - **DNS Protocol** – Handling domain resolution.

## 📄 Documentation & Challenges

### Setup Process:
1. Created a **GitHub repository** for version control.
2. Developed website using **HTML and CSS**.
3. Configured **GitHub Pages** for free hosting.
4. Verified **DNS resolution** and ensured accessibility.

### 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions:
- **Challenge**:
  1. Configuring custom domain
  2. Ensuring HTTPS encryption
  3. Making the site accessible worldwide
- **Solutions**:
  1. Used GitHub's built-in DNS management
  2. Used GitHub Pages' free SSL certificate
  3. Verified DNS propagation and IP resolution

---

## 🔒 Bonus: Security Features
We implemented basic **security measures** to enhance the project:
- **HTTPS Encryption** – Ensuring secure communication.
- **Basic Firewall Rules** – Restricting unauthorized access.

---

## **Part 2: Enhancing Security, Performance & Monitoring**

To improve our website, we implemented several features aimed at **security, speed, and monitoring**.

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **✅ HTTPS Encryption (SSL Certificate)** – We enabled **HTTPS** using **GitHub Pages' free SSL** to ensure encrypted connections and protect user data from attackers.
- **✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection** – To prevent XSS attacks, we implemented **DOMPurify** in our JavaScript to sanitize user input and remove malicious scripts.

---

### ⚡ Performance Optimization
- **✅ Content Delivery Network (CDN)** – Our website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, which uses a global **CDN** to serve content quickly to users worldwide.
- **✅ Lazy Loading Images** – We implemented the `loading="lazy"` attribute on images, ensuring they only load when needed, reducing page load time.

---

### 📊 Network Monitoring & Security Analysis
- **✅ Google Analytics** – We integrated **Google Analytics** to monitor website traffic, track user behavior, and detect potential security risks.

---

## Our Conclusion
Through this project, CyberNexus successfully combined **networking principles with web development** to build an accessible, informative, and secure website. This hands-on experience reinforced our understanding of **DNS, IP addressing, protocols, and network security**.

In part 2, these enhancements have significantly improved our website’s **security, speed, and monitoring capabilities**, making it more resilient to attacks and ensuring a better user experience.
