### **🌐 CyberNexus Networking Project**  

---

## **📌 Project Task**  
As part of our **Computer Networking project**, we have developed a fully functional website to demonstrate fundamental networking principles. This project includes:  

1. **Domain & Hosting** – Setting up a domain and hosting service.  
2. **Website Development** – Creating a basic website using HTML and CSS.  
3. **Networking Aspects** – Applying core networking concepts such as DNS, IP addressing, and protocols.  
4. **Documentation** – Providing a detailed report on our setup, challenges, and networking principles.
5. **Bonus Features** - Impementing security features such as HTTPS and Firewall

## **🌍 Domain & Hosting**  
We chose **GitHub Pages** as our hosting platform due to its reliability and ease of deployment for static websites. Our website is live at:  
🔗 **[CyberNexus Networking Hub](https://drippyeman.github.io/groupcybernexus/)**  

Hosting Details:  
- **Hosting Service**: GitHub Pages  
- **Domain Name**: drippyeman.github.io/groupcybernexus  
- **DNS Handling**: GitHub automatically assigns an IP address and manages DNS resolution.  

---

## **🛠 Website Setup**  
We built the website using the following technologies:  
 **HTML & CSS** – Structuring and styling the website.  
 **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and managing version control.  

---

## **🌐 Networking Aspects**  
To ensure our website is **accessible online**, we applied key networking principles:  

🔹 **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Resolves our GitHub Pages domain to an IP address.  
🔹 **IP Addressing** – GitHub assigns an IP for hosting, making it globally reachable.  
🔹 **Protocols Used:**  
   - **HTTP/HTTPS** – Communication between clients and the server.  
   - **TCP/IP** – Ensuring reliable data transfer.  
   - **DNS Protocol** – Handling domain resolution.

## **📄 Documentation & Challenges**  
###  Setup Process 
1. Created a **GitHub repository** for version control.  
2. Developed website using **HTML and CSS**.  
3. Configured **GitHub Pages** for free hosting.  
4. Verified **DNS resolution** and ensured accessibility.  

### **🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions**  
Challenge
1.Configuring custom domain 
2.Ensuring HTTPS encryption
3.Making the site accessible worldwide

Solutions
1.Used GitHub's built-in DNS management
2.Used GitHub Pages' free SSL certificate
3.Verified DNS propagation and IP resolution
